Description of the project:
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. 
This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project
with all other following projects:
HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

What’s a command interpreter?
It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case.
1-Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
2-Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
3-Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
4-Update attributes of an object
5-Destroy an object

Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit

But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
