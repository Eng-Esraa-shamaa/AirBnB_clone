Project Description
This is the first part of the AirBnB clone project where we worked on the backend of the project whiles interfacing it with a console application with the help of the cmd module in python.

Data (python objects) generated are stored in a json file and can be accessed with the help of the json module in python

The console will perform the following tasks:

- create a new object
- retrive an object from a file
- do operations on objects
- destroy an object

How to use it
It can work in two different modes:

Interactive and Non-interactive.

In Interactive mode, the console will display a prompt (hbnb) indicating that the user can write and execute a command. After the command is run, the prompt will appear again a wait for a new command. This can go indefinitely as long as the user does not exit the program.

In Non-interactive mode, the shell will need to be run with a command input piped into its execution so that the command is run as soon as the Shell starts. In this mode no prompt will appear, and no further input will be expected from the user.

All the test are defined in the tests folder.
